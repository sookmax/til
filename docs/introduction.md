# Introduction

Hello there! I'm Sook, a web developer ðŸ‘‹.

This website is where I document what I learn in a daily basiseâ€”or as frequent as possible.

Most of the information you'll find here is related to _web development_ and _software engineering_. I hope one day this website grows to such an extent that it could function as a knowledge base for my future self and for those that seek such information. I don't intend to mindlessly copy-and-paste what I can find on the internetâ€”that kind of information is already plentiful on the web, echoing from one blog post to anotherâ€”but instead I would like to produce _quality contents with deeper insights_ by continuing to ask why stuffs work such way and dig deeper into the topics.

I hope you find something useful here and yes, let's keep learning new things every day together!
