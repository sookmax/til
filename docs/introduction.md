# Introduction

Welcome to _TIL by Sook_!

Hi, I'm Sook, a web developer. This website is where I document what I learn in a daily basisâ€”or as frequent as possible.

Most of the information you find here are not my original contents or writings but rather they are a compilation of useful and insightful information gathered from all over the web.

I hope you find something useful here, and let's keep learning new things every day!
