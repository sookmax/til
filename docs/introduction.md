# Introduction

Hello there! I'm Sook, a web developer ðŸ‘‹.

This website is where I document what I learn in a daily basisâ€”or as frequent as possible.

Most of the information you'll find here is related to _web development_ and _software engineering_. I hope one day this website grows to such an extent that it could function as a knowledge base for my future self and for those that seek such information.

I hope you find something useful here and yes, let's keep learning every day together!

> The more I live, the more I learn. The more I learn, the more I realize, the less I know.
