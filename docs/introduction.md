# Introduction

Welcome to _TIL by Sook_!

Hi, I'm Sook, a web developer. This website is where I document what I learn in a daily basisâ€”or as frequent as possible.

Most of the information you can find here are not my original contents but rather they are a compilation of useful and insightful information found all over the web. In that sense, I respect the original sources of the information presented in this website, and so I will provide the origin at the beginning of each page whenever possible. And also in the case where I transcribe the information from said sources verbatim or extract excerpts from them, _blockquotes_ or some other forms of stylized _quotes_ will be used to emphasize they are not in my own words.

I hope you find something useful here, and let's keep learning new things every day!
