# TDD, Where Dit It All Go Wrong

Information in this page is based on my watching the youtube video called, **TDD, Where Dit It All Go Wrong (Ian Cooper)**

```mdx-code-block

  I think the most important thing to take away from and understanding of that

  implementation details, test behaviors.

## How to do TDD right

### Wrong things to do

- Many practice TDD by using _adding a new method to a class_ as the trigger to write a test.
- A test-case per class approach fails to capture the ethos for TDD.
- Adding a new class is not the trigger for writing tests.
- Do not write tests for implementation details &ndash; these change!

### Correct things to do

- In TDD, creating a new test is that you have a requirement you want to implement.
- the trigger is implementing a requirement.
- Test the public API.
  - `exports` from a module.
  - the stable idea of your software; how you implement the requirement is unstable.
  - the contract your software has with the world.
- Writing tests to cover the use cases or stories.

<blockquote className="styled">
  The object of TDD is to test <strong>behaviors</strong> in the system.
</blockquote>

<blockquote className="styled">
  When we write a test, we imagine the perfect interface for our operation. We
  are telling ourselves a story about how the operation will look from the
  outside. Our story won't always come true, but it's better to start from the
  best possible application programming interface (API) and work backward.
</blockquote>

<blockquote className="styled">
  The unit of isolation is the <strong>test</strong>, not the thing{" "}
  <strong>under test</strong>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote className="styled">
  When we are focusing on testing individual <em>methods</em> of a class, We
  can't refactor easily because implementation details are exposed to tests.
</blockquote>

## Red-Green-Refactor

<blockquote className="styled">
  <em>Refactor</em> is the key in this red-green-refactor cycle.
</blockquote>

### Red

<blockquote className="styled">
  Write a little test that doesn't work, and perhaps doesn't even compile at
  first in the absence of correct implementation.
</blockquote>

### Green

<blockquote className="styled">
  Make the test work quickly, committing whatever <em>sins</em> necessary in the
  process.
</blockquote>

<blockquote className="styled">
  What we're doing is making the test passed by the quickest (and perhaps
  dirtiest) process possible.
</blockquote>

<blockquote className="styled">
  do not try to make it beautiful, do not put patterns in there yet, and just
  write line after line of code until it works.
</blockquote>

### Refactor

<blockquote className="styled">
  Eliminate all of the duplications created in merely getting the test to work
  in <em>green</em> phase (make good code).
</blockquote>

> The different phases have different purposes. They call for different styles of solution, different aesthetic viewpoints. The first three phases need to go by quickly, so we get to a known state with the new functionality. **We can commit any number of sins to get there, because speed trumps design, just for that brief moment.**
>
> – Kent Beck, TDD by Example

<blockquote className="styled">
  Kent's point is essentially you can't do two things at once easily. You can't
  both understand the solution to the problem and engineer the code right.
</blockquote>

### Clean Code When?

<blockquote className="styled">
  The refactoring step is when we produce clean code.
</blockquote>

- It's when you remove duplication – _Beck_
- It's when you sanitize the code smells – _Fowler_
- It's when you apply patterns – _Kerievsky_

<blockquote className="styled">
  Because now you have a clear idea of what your solution is.
</blockquote>

<blockquote className="styled">
  You do not write new unit tests when refactoring to clean code.
</blockquote>

<blockquote className="styled">
  Refactoring is a process of safe moves that let you essentially change{" "}
  <em>the design of the code</em>. They do not change <em>the behavior</em>.
  Your behavior is covered by the original test.
</blockquote>

> Dependency is the key problem in software development at all scales
>
> – Kent Beck, TDD BY Example

<blockquote className="styled">
  We need to eliminate dependency between our tests and our code.
</blockquote>

<blockquote className="styled">
  Coupling is what kills all software so strive to decouple your tests from your
  implementation details. Focus on your public contract, your stable API and
  leave your implementation details free of tests and avoid heavy mocking.
</blockquote>

<blockquote className="styled">
  This allows us to refactor implementations without changing the tests. Don't
  bake implementation details into tests!
</blockquote>

## Code Smells

<figcaption align="left">Refactoring by Martin Fowler</figcaption>

</figure>

<blockquote className="styled">
  Fowler's book provides both step-by-step, safe recipes for performing a
  refactoring as well as outlining the smells in code that trigger those
  refactorings.
</blockquote>

> Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it **does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure.** It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimizes the chances of introducing bugs. In essence when you refactor you are improving the design of the code after it has been written.
>
> – Martin Fowler, _Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code_

<blockquote className="styled">
  Kerievsky suggests we don't try to implement patterns in the system under
  test. We implement patterns as improvements to the code in the refactoring
  step.
</blockquote>

<blockquote className="styled">
  The ideal step for applying patterns is the refactoring step because at this
  point I know what the solution is; I've written one (in the green phase). Now
  I can clean up by making a pattern.

### Hexagonal Architecture: Ports and Adapters

This is unfortunately the common way that testing occurs in a lot of organizations. Before we release the software, there is a big big wave of manual testing going on, everyone's getting into the system running manual scripts, etc. Then below that there's some sort of big suite of selenium tests and then we have integration tests and the bottom we have a few developer tests.

This is a bit of a disaster, why?

First of all, this is really expensive unrepeatable, so you may want to automate your way out of that situation.

This one is very problematic and I'll tell you why.

If I change my UI to give it a nice classy new look and feel, I may not be changing any of the behaviors of my software. They do exactly the same thing that they did yesterday; I've just cleaned up the UI.

But these tools all break.

I'm driving the tools to test the behavior of my system, but they all break because I changed the way that my widgets work.

So they are very fragile and they also run very slowly. Quite often, when you run them overnight and you get the blame game in the morning. Someone's job in the organization is to determine who is to blame for last night's test failing.

If you have found yourself in a situation where you have somebody whose job every morning is to determine who's to blame for the test failing, you are doing it wrong.

So what you want is what's called the testing pyramid.

<br />

<img src="/img/test-pyramid.png" style={{height: "400px"}} />

The majority of your code should be tested by your developer tests. A small amount of code up here should test your widgets work correctly (UI tests) and in between there's a certain amount of integration testing where the two gets hooked together.
